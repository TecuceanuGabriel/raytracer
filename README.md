# Raytracer
This project is a simple raytracer implemented in C++. Raytracing is a rendering 
technique that simulates the way light rays interact with objects to create
realistic images.

# Features
- Geometric shapes: supports rendering of spheres.
- Camera configuration: allows for setting the camera position, orientation, 
focal length.
- Image output: renders the scene to a .ppm file.

# Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TecuceanuGabriel/raytracer.git
cd raytracer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Aknowledgements
This project was inspired by the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter 
Shirley. It serves as a learning exercise to understand the basics of raytracing 
and computer graphics.
